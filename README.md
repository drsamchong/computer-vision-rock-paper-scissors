# Computer Vision RPS

This project aims to develop an implementation of a Rock-Paper-Scissors game which uses input from a webcam to play the game. 
It uses Python 3.9 and a Keras model built and trained on Teachable-Machine.

## Milestone 1

The first project milestone involved setting up the environment for the project. Git is used for version control and the repository is hosted on GitHub.

## Milestone 2

![Teachable-machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) was used to capture images from a webcam to form a set of training data which cover four classes: Rock, Paper, Scissors and None. The model was trained using the default hyperparameters and the Keras model was exported as an hdf5 file along with the labels.
